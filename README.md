#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

 ðŸ“š Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Quantitative Economics at the University of Pittsburgh, where I also earned my Bachelorâ€™s in Statistics and Economics. My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in data science and econometrics; complemented by hands-on experience leading a data analysis team focused on enhancing student financial literacy. You can learn more about me in my [university bio](https://www.mqe.pitt.edu/people/ant-122 ).


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enhancing and applying my skills in data science and econometric modeling, aiming to address real-world economic challenges.

ðŸ”Ž Iâ€™m eager to explore data science, econometric modeling, and machine learning approaches, particularly in research applications such as analyzing consumer behavior, risk management, improving business efficiencies, and examining labor market factors.

ðŸ‘‰ Letâ€™s connect! Iâ€™d love to network with fellow professionals and students. Feel free to reach out on [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=flat&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)]([http://www.linkedin.com/in/rory-quinlan])

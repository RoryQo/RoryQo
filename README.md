## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Quantitative Economics at the University of Pittsburgh, where I also earned my Bachelorâ€™s in Economics and Statistics. My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in data analysis and econometrics.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enhancing my skills in advanced data analytics and econometric modeling, focusing on how these tools can solve real-world economic issues.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that involve data analysis, predictive modeling, and financial literacy initiatives that make a positive impact on communities.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m eager to explore methodologies in econometric modeling and machine learning applications, including:
Humanitarian Efforts: Analyzing socio-economic factors to guide resource allocation.
Finance: Analyzing credit scoring and market trends.
Healthcare: Utilizing predictive analytics for better outcomes.
Marketing: Implementing customer segmentation strategies.
Transportation: Optimizing routes for efficiency.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my work as the Head of the Data Analysis Team at the Financial Wellness Center, my research projects on college tuition variation, or any of these machine learning applications!
ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can connect with me here on GitHub or email me at [your-email@example.com].
âš¡ Fun fact: Just as sharks have adapted and thrived for over 400 million years, I aim to leverage my skills in data analysis and econometrics to adapt to and address pressing economic challenges. Plus, did you know that sharks are older than trees and have survived five mass extinction events? Their resilience inspires me to embrace challenges and seek innovative solutions in my field! ðŸ¦ˆ

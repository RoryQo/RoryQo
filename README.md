## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Quantitative Economics at the University of Pittsburgh, where I also earned my Bachelorâ€™s in Economics and Statistics. My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in data analysis and econometrics.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enhancing my skills in advanced data analytics and econometric modeling, focusing on how these tools can solve real-world economic issues.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that involve data analysis, predictive modeling, and financial literacy initiatives that make a positive impact on communities.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m exploreing methodologies in econometric modeling and machine learning applications, including:

Student Performance Prediction: Developing models to predict student adaptability to online learning, helping educators optimize their teaching methods.

Tuition Pricing Analysis: Using regression analysis to model college tuition variation and provide insights into pricing strategies.

Clustering for Resource Allocation: Employing K-means clustering to categorize countries based on socio-economic factors for humanitarian aid distribution.

Bayesian Analysis for Correlation Studies: Analyzing age correlation in married couples using Bayesian methods to improve predictive accuracy.

Time Series Forecasting: Implementing techniques to forecast financial trends based on historical data, supporting better decision-making.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my work as the Head of the Data Analysis Team at the Financial Wellness Center, my research projects on college tuition variation, or any of these machine learning applications!

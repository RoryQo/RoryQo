My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in data analysis and econometrics.  | [University Bio](https://www.mqe.pitt.edu/people/ant-122 ) | [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rory-quinlan)


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enhancing my skills in advanced data analytics and econometric modeling, focusing on how these tools can solve real-world economic issues.

ðŸ”Ž Iâ€™m eager to explore methodologies in econometric modeling and machine learning applications in research, such as predicting consumer demand, assessing policy impacts, analyzing labor market factors, evaluating financial risk, and exploring income inequality patterns.

âš¡ Fun fact: did you know that sharks are older than trees and have survived five mass extinction events? Their resilience inspires me to embrace challenges and seek innovative solutions in my field! ðŸ¦ˆ
